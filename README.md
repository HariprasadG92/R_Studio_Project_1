# R_Studio_Projects
In this R studio projects repository, I have done projects upon web scraping, web scraping, data visualisation, simple linear regression and multi- linear regression. 

In the Web Scraping project, I did "The numbers" website scraping to scrap the Movies With Lowest Budgets to Earn $1 Million at US Box Office and stored it in the movies.csv file.
