# R_Studio_Projects
In this R studio projects repository, I have done projects upon web scraping, data visualisation. 

In the Web Scraping project, I did "The numbers" website which as the list hollywood movies and their financial data analysis in which i have scraped the Movies With Lowest Budgets to Earn $1 Million at US Box Office and stored it in the movies.csv file.

In the Data Visualisation project, I visualised the dataset in movies.csv. I visualised the World wide Gross Production of all the mmovies listed in the dataset using bar graph.

In the Simple Linear Regression, I took a data set of Diabetes prediction data and considered two data sets age and BMI . Next I split the data set into test set and training set then applied regression on both dataset and visualised the results between the age and BMI.
